# 5. Weighted Graph

The files [graph.h](graph.h) and [graph.c](graph.c) implement a Graph data structure, along with an algorithm to find articulation points, and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for finding the shortest distance between two vertices.

## Usage

```sh
make
./graph
```

### Input

![The graph being used](graph.png)

The graph data to use is hard-coded in [main.c](main.c):
```c
Graph* g = construct_graph(6);  // define a graph with vertices 0 thru 5
graph_add_edge(g, 0, 1, 10.0);  // add edge from 0 -> 1, with weight 10.0
graph_add_edge(g, 0, 2, 10.0);
graph_add_edge(g, 1, 3, 10.0);
graph_add_edge(g, 1, 4, 10.0);
graph_add_edge(g, 2, 3, 10.0);
graph_add_edge(g, 3, 5, 10.0);
graph_add_edge(g, 4, 5, 10.0);
graph_add_edge(g, 5, 3, 10.0);
```
